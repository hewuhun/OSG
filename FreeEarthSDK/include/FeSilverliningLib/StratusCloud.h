/** Renders a deck of stratus clouds, modeled by two textured planes with fog between them.
   The cloud texture is procedurally generated and will use alpha to simulate "broken cloud
   decks" if the specified coverage is less than 1.0. "Scud" effects are also supported, meaning
   fog effects extend above and below the modeled deck in an irregular manner to better simulate
   the experience of flying just above or below the clouds.

   Stratus clouds are smart enough to not do fog effects if you're flying through a "hole" in
   a broken cloud deck.

   Stratus clouds are always drawn relative to the camera position. Tricks with texture mapping
   are employed to provide the illusion of motion relative to the cloud, but you'll never reach
   the edge of a stratus cloud.
