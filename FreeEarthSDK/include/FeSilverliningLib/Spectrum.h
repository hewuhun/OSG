/** Models a full spectrum of electromagnetic energy. Derived classes must populate
   the powers[] array in their constructors. This class also models the passage
   of this energy through the atmosphere under given conditions, and converts the
   spectrum to XYZ color data. Limited to the visible range of 380-780 nm.

   For a description of some of the ideas behind this class, see

   through the atmosphere, are returned.

   \param zenithAngle The angle between the zenith and the direction of the light source emitting
   the simulated spectrum.
   \param cosZenith The cosine of the zenith angle.
   \param T The simulated atmospheric turbidity (see AtmosphericConditions::SetTurbidity())
   \param altitude The simulated altitude in meters above mean sea level.
   \param directIrradiance A reference to a Spectrum object that will receive the spectral
   energy directly from the light source that survives transmission through the atmosphere.
   \param scatteredIrradiance A reference to a Spectrum object that will receive the spectral
   energy scattered by the atmosphere, which makes up "skylight."
