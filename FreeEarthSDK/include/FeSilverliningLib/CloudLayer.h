/** A collection of clouds of uniform classification organized into a "deck" of similar altitudes.

   CloudLayer is a bse class that cannot be directly instantiated; instead, it is returned by
   the class factory CloudLayerFactory. Call CloudLayerFactory::Create() to obtain a CloudLayer object
   for a specific cloud type.

   Once created, you'll want to set the CloudLayer's dimensions and density (coverage) using the
   SetBaseWidth(), SetBaseLength(), SetBaseAltitude(), SetThickness(), and SetDensity() methods.
   You will also need to position it using SetLayerPosition().

   Initially, a CloudLayer will not contain any clouds. Once specifying your preferences for the
   layer's dimensions and density, you must then call SeedClouds() to simulate cloud growth within
   the cloud deck.

   Once your CloudLayer object is created, configured, and seeded, you may then pass it into
   AtmosphericConditions::AddCloudLayer() to add it to your scene.

    Once "seeded", the above methods to modify the layer's dimensions and density
    will have no effect - they are burned in at that point. You may, however, call SetLayerPosition()
    at runtime. To change the other properties of the cloud layer at runtime, you need to remove
    the cloud layer and re-create it.

   See SetBaseWidth() for information on important differences between different types of
   CloudLayers.

   that are displayed at different times, it may make sense to create them all when your

/** Sets the size of the CloudLayer along the X axis. The cloud layer must be at least as
   big as the size of individual clouds within it. The size of the cloud layer may have
   important performance and visual impacts, so it should be chosen with care. Here are some
   general guidelines for setting the cloud layer dimensions:

   \li Cumulus congestus, mediocris, and sandstorms: The number of clouds created is proportional to the
   square of the layer dimensions, so performance will degrade quickly if unreasonably high
   dimensions are chosen. A balance must be found between performance (not having
   too many clouds to render at real-time speed) and visual acceptability (having enough
   clouds to fill the scene.) Dimensions of around 30 km or so generally fulfill both demands,
   but the number of clouds also depends on the cloud layer density (see SetDensity()).

   \li Stratus: The width represents the size of the entire stratus cloud layer. If this is an
   infinite stratus layer, this value is ignored and the SilverLining.config setting
   stratus-deck-width is used instead.

   \li Cumulonimbus: Due to the large size of cumulonimbus clouds and their isolated organization
   along "squall lines", it's not realistic to have a rectangular deck of cumulonimbus clouds.
   Instead, the size of the cumulonimbus cloud layer will reflect the size of a single
   cumulonimbus cloud that fills the entire layer. Choose dimensions that reflect the size of
   the cloud itself, typically on the order of 5 km.

   \li Cirrus: Cirrus decks are rendered as a high, textured plane, but it does not extend
   infinitely like stratus decks do. A large enough dimension should be chosen to fill the
   sky of your scene at the deck's altitude; typically, 100,000 meters is appropriate.

   \li Stratocumulus: Stratocumulus clouds are rendered using 3D volumetric data that can be very
   memory-intensive. Cloud layer sizes above 50,000 meters are not recommended, and will also result
   in sampling artifacts. This upper bound is enforced by the stratocumulus-max-size setting in
   resources/silverlining.config.

   \li Stratus: Found very low; typically 500-2000 m.
   \li Cirrus: Found very high; 6000 m or higher.
   \li Sandstorm: Set to the local ground altitude to position the sandstorm on the ground.

    SetBaseAltitude() may be called at runtime after a cloud layer has been seeded to change its position,
    and should be called before seeding the cloud layer.

    The updateCloudPositions indicates whether the cloud altitudes within this layer should be updated
    immediately. If set to false, individual clouds will not update until they are repositioned by other

   \li Cumulus congestus, mediocris: The thickness specifies the variance in the altitude of
   the bottoms of each individual cloud within the CloudLayer. The actual height of each cloud
   is determined procedurally as part of the cloud growth model, and is not affected by
   SetThickness(). So, setting the thickness to 0 would result in a layer of clouds that all
   start at the same base altitude; setting a thickness of 100 would provide for some variance
   for increased realism. In reality, cloud layers rest on top of an air mass that cause most
   of the clouds to have flattened bottoms that start at roughly the same altitude.

   \li Cumulonimbus: SetThickness() is unused for cumulonimbus clouds. The height of the cloud
   will be determined proportionally from the setting in SetBaseWidth().

   \li Stratus: The thickness in this case specifies the actual thickness of the stratus deck,
   that is, the distance between the top and bottom of the stratus layer. Stratus clouds vary
   in thickness; 1000-2000 m are reasonable values. The thickness of the stratus deck will not
   impact performance, unlike cumulus decks.

   \li Stratocumulus: Like stratus, the thickness in this case specifies the actual thickness
   of the stratocumulus layer. This needs to be thick enough to contain the clouds within this
   layer; typically 3000 meters should suffice. If it's too small, the clouds will be unrealistically
   small and also transmit too much sunlight, so set this with care.

   \li Cirrus: The thickness is ignored for cirrus decks; cirrus decks are modeled as infinitely
   thin layers of ice crystals at high altitude.

   \li Sandstorm: Pass 0 to ensure a flat bottom to the sandstorm, or just leave this unspecified.

    to be centered over, for example. A right-handed coordinate system where Z points up would pass
    in X and -Y instead.

    Cloud positions may move over time in response to
   simulated wind (see AtmosphericConditions::SetWind()).

    If you are using a custom set of basis vectors, be sure that you have called
    Atmosphere::SetUpVector() and Atmosphere::SetRightVector() before calling this method. The cloud
    layer will be oriented according to the basis defined by the current up and right vectors

    want to set the up and right vectors to reflect the local basis at the cloud's location,
    and then set these back to reflect the eyepoint before rendering with Atmosphere::DrawSky()
    and Atmosphere::DrawObjects().

   Calling SetLayerPosition will reset any accumulated wind drift as well.

    SetLayerPosition() and SetBaseAltitude() are the only methods on a CloudLayer that you
    may change at runtime, after the CloudLayer has been seeded and added into the scene. Modifying
    other properties of the CloudLayer after it's been seeded require removing the CloudLayer from
    your AtmosphericConditions, and re-creating the layer.

   The specific effect of "infinite" varies by the cloud layer type. Cumulus congestus and mediocris cloud
   layers behave as described above, where individual clouds wrap around the cloud layer's boundaries relative
   to the camera position. For cirrus and cirrocumulus clouds, setting them to "infinite"  means they
   are not affected by wind and remain fixed above the camera position. Infinite stratus cloud layers remain
   positioned relative to the camera position and simulate relative motion by rotating its texture coordinates.
