   Relighting the clouds is a relatively expensive operation, so for real
   time applications you probably won't want to relight the clouds every
   frame. The relightFrequencyMS parameter allows you to specify the interval,
   in milliseconds, between cloud relighting passes. The sky will continue
   to update in real time, along with the position of the sun, moon, and

   MillisecondTimer with SetMillisecondTimer(), the interval will be computed
   based on its concept of time.

   parameter is set to -1, cloud relighting will only happen in response to
   calls to AtmosphericConditions::SetTime().
