        that includes bathymetry data - that is, it extends below sea level to include the surface of the sea floor - Triton
        can use this to obtain the depth of the water at each point. This is used for transparency effects and breaking waves
        at shorelines, and to prevent Triton from drawing water over the terrain.

        Take care to only call this method when your height map's content changes. Triton must make a system memory copy of it
        for height queries, which impacts performance.

        For accurate water surface height queries near the shore, DirectX9 users must provide a lockable texture (meaning it is
        not created in the default pool, or it is created with render target usage,) in D3DFMT_R32F format. DirectX11 users

        If no height map is provided, you can instead use Triton::Ocean::SetDepth() to specify a uniformly sloping sea floor

        Optionally sets a depth texture map used for terrain / water blending at coastlines. The preferred approach is to use
        SetHeightMap() instead, but sometimes height maps cannot be generated easily or quickly enough. SetDepthMap()
        provides a simpler alternative, especially if you already have a depth texture available as part of your engine.

        To go this route, you would pass your depth texture in via SetDepthMap() every frame once it contains terrain
        information. Triton will de-project it into world space, and use it to compute how much water lies behind each 
        vertex of the ocean mesh. 
        
        Be sure Triton's ocean itself has not been rendered into the depth map!

        There are a few downsides to this approach, which is why we recommend using SetHeightMap() instead whenever 
        possible:

        - The depth map cannot be used to provide accurate height queries in shallow water; as a result, you may receive
          height queries representing high waves in shallow harbors when using SetDepthMap() together with 
          Triton::Ocean::GetHeight().

        - The depth map must be updated every frame, while height maps may be set once and regenerated only if the viewpoint
          leaves the area it covers.

        - The depths computed using the depth map will be along the line of sight from the camera to the seafloor, instead of
          directly underneath each ocean point. This can lead to the transparency of water at the shoreline varying with the
          view angle, exposing z-fighting only from certain angles. You will probably need to use higher underwater visibility
          settings with SetDepthMap() than you used with SetHeightMap() for smooth blending.

        - The effect is only as good as your depth buffer resolution. If you have a distant far clip plane, and/or a close near
          clip plane, banding may occur.

        - It hasn't been used in the field as much as SetHeightMap(), especially the DirectX implementation. If you discover
          bugs with it, please contact support@sundog-soft.com.

        If a height map has been provided via SetHeightMap(), the depth map will not be used.

    /** Passes in an optional planar reflection map used for rendering local reflections in the water.
        Triton can use planar reflection map & environment map together. Alpha channel in planar
        reflection map is used to blend between planar reflection & environment map. If planar reflection
        is not used Triton falls back to environment map (it is the same result as if planar reflection had
        0 on alpha in every texel).

        \param textureMap    A 2D map texture resource, which should be cast to a TextureHandle.
                             Under OpenGL, this must be a GLuint indicating the ID of the GL_TEXTURE_2D
                             returned from glGenTextures. Under DirectX9, this must be a LPDIRECT3DTEXTURE9.
                             Under DirectX11, this must be a ID3D11ShaderResourceView pointer with an underlying
                             ViewDimension of D3D11_SRV_DIMENSION_TEXTURE2D.

        \param textureMatrix A required texture matrix used to project the vector computed by triton to reflection map
                             texture coordinates. Generally, this will be the main scene's view rotation matrix * projection matrix,
                             multiplied by a translation of (1, 1, 1) and then by a scale of (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) to transform
                             normalized device coordinates to texture coordinates. Triton's "Input" is a view vector
                             perturbed by normal.xy components. Such a vector approximates wave reflection wiggle and
                             can be used to directly access planar reflection map. See description of parameter
                             normalDisplacementScale to learn why reflection vector cannot be used directly to access
                             the planar reflection map. The input Vector passed to textureMatrix will be defined in
                             world space coordinates translated to the view point. In other words this coordinate space
                             has the same orientation as world space but its origin (point 0,0,0) is moved to the camera
                             location. This is the same coordinate space that env map projection uses. Advanced users may
                             see how reflection (P) variable is handled in Triton pixel (fragment) shaders.

        \param normalDisplacementScale
                             A scale factor used to perturb vertex by normal.xy to get more realistic reflection from rough waves.
                             Range of reasonable values is 0..4. Default is 0.125
                             Realtime bumpy surface reflection approaches are usually based on aproximation of reflection
                             from flat surface. However, method of reflection based on planar projection has serious limitation.
                             It assumes that view vector(and reflection vector) angle strictly corresponds to the incident point
                             on the surface where vector was reflected.
                             If surface is not perfectly flat and water waves are of course an example of such surface,
                             above assumption fails and many points at the ocean surface can reflect vectors at the same direction.
                             If such reflection was used to address a planar map texel we could see reflections of the objects at
                             random points on the surface. To avoid such effect, usually some limits are imposed on reflected vector or
                             reflected texture coords.
                             Triton adopts classic approach to the above problem which works by actually using a view vector
                             perturbed by an offset computed from normal.xy scaled by normalDisplacementScale. Since normal.xy
                             components are never larger than unit value we can be sure that reflection vector will fit in finite
                             margin defined by normalDisplacementScale.
